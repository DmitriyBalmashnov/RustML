# RustML

My goals with this project:
 * Solidify my Linear Algebra knowledge
 * Learn some fundamental Rust
 * Implement basic gradient descent for Linear regression, Logistic regression and possibly others

One may say, you are reinventing the wheel.  
My goal here is not to reinvent it, but understand the wheel better by building it myself.  
There are projects which already do just this probably better - this is just my attempt at understanding it wholly. 


Tasks:

[X] Create a rudimentary Matrix implementation for my use  
[X] Implement gradient descent for Linear regression  
[ ] Implement Logistic regression  
[ ] Explore further  

Example given in the main.rs makes use of the housing prices dataset found at: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashydv/housing-dataset?resource=download
